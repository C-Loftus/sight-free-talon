# Using this Code with Different Abilities

## Using this Repo with Blindness or Vision Impairment

This repository works best with NVDA and Windows. Since Talon always has the chance of misrecognitions and thus accidental key presses, I recommend using both the `user.sound_on_keypress` and `user.disable_keypresses` settings in order to reduce the risk and impact of misrecognitions. These will help to make unintended side effects more apparent or outright prevent them. Talon's ability to scope settings based on the currently focused window allows you to easily switch these features on/off depending when you find them necessary.

## Using this Repo with General Eye Strain

Some sighted users may simply want to reduce eye strain without needing to use a screen reader. This repository is designed to help in this situation, and make it easier to transition one's workflow to use the eyes less. In this scenario, I recommend simply using the default setting configuration and using many of the built in TTS tools, such as the Read Aloud functionality in Microsoft Edge to reduce the amount one needs to read.

I recommend using the screen curtain feature in NVDA to entirely turn off the screen when you do not need it. This eliminates all light, both blue light and other colors, but still lets you use your computer and listen to audio output.
