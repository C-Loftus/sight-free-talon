Once content is made accessible to a screen reader, the main problem becomes synthesizing it down into discrete components that can be acted upon and synthesized into flat and succinct representations. The problem with Talon, as with most complicated software is that there is so much functionality, so much to learn, and thus so much to potentially go wrong. This quickly creates a user experience burden.

Most users of all backgrounds and abilities don't use all potential input methods for their computer. They simply use the ones with the least friction at the moment. Sighted people generally have abnormally high amounts of mouse usage, often unoptimally so. Whereas visually impaired people generally have abnormally high amounts of keyboard usage, and often do not take advantage of voice commands.

In many cases, low vision accessibility is as much a question of what not to include instead of what to include.
