# Installing

This repository is in frequent development. I suggest using git to clone the repository and then updating it frequently. If you are not familiar with git, you can download the repository as a zip file and unzip it into your Talon user directory.

On Windows your user directory is located at ` %APPDATA%\Talon\user`. On MacOS and Linux your user directory is located at `~/.talon/user`.
