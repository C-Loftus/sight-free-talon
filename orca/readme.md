# Orca Support

TODO. Blocked until tts via a socket is implemented.

## Notes

Orca is often out of date within Linux package managers (apt on Debian/Ubuntu for instance). Therefore, it is recommended to install from source or use a distribution like Arch or Fedora with packages that are updated more frequently. Once Orca implements support for a socket connection through which text-to-speech (TTS) can be sent, it is likely that older versions will stay in system package managers for a significant amount of time.
