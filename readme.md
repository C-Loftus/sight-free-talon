# Sight-Free-Talon

This repository is intended to hold code useful for using Talon with a vision impairment or eye strain. This code may allow easier interaction with tools like screen readers, text-to-speech, or forms of alternative user feedback like buzzers, pedals, etc.

The current priority is to focus on Windows. This repository is relatively experimental.

# Contributing

I am developing this as I deal with my own eye strain issues. Thus, I greatly appreciate any user contributions no matter how big or small. Please feel free to file issues for any functionality you would like even if you cannot implement them. For those who wish to contribute, any of the open issues are a good place to start. If you are a user with a visual impairment please get in touch with me I would love to get your design feedback

For any other inquiries regarding this project contact me via the methods in my GitHub bio.
