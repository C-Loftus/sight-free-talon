# Sight-Free-Talon

This repository is intended to hold code useful for using Talon with a vision impairment or eye strain. This code may allow easier interaction with tools like screen readers, text-to-speech, or forms of alternative user feedback like buzzers, pedals, etc.

The current priority is to focus on Windows. This repository is relatively experimental.

The motivation for this repository is the fact that many screen readers and other tools for visual impairment are very dependent upon keyboard and hand usage. This repository tries to decouple that. Also, by leveraging the macro potential of Talon, we can automate tasks that would potentially take a much longer time with a screen reader. Talon also allows easier integration of tools like foot pedals and the significant pre-existing ecosystem of tools to help automate user input or navigation

# Contributing

I am developing this as I deal with my own eye strain issues. Thus, **I greatly appreciate any user contributions no matter how big or small, in any capacity technical or not.** Please feel free to file issues for any functionality you would like, even if you cannot implement them. For those who wish to contribute, any of the open issues are a good place to start. If you are a user with a visual impairment please get in touch with me I would love to get your design feedback.

For any other inquiries regarding this project contact me via the methods in my GitHub bio.
