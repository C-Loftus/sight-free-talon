This repository is intended to hold code useful for using Talon with a vision impairment or eye strain. This code may allow easier ineraction with tools like screen readers, text-to-speech, or forms of alternative user feedback like buzzers, pedals, etc.

The current priority is to focus on Windows. This repository is relatively experimental.
