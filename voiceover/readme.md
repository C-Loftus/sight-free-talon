# VoiceOver

This integration is a work in progress. VoiceOver is difficult to customize or script since it is all closed source and most of the best APIs are only able to be queried via objc or swift, not Python unless ffi is brought into play. 

## Setup

- Open VoiceOver Utility and check "Allow VoiceOver to be controller with AppleScript".
- Enable Terminal app in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility.
- Accept Terminal VoiceOver automation permissions when prompted. (You can manage these later in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Automation).
